# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction

This project predicts the diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) of breast cancer using Decision Tree Classification and Logistic Regression.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Scikit-learn

## Overview

The repository contains Jupyter Notebooks implementing two machine learning models for predicting breast cancer diagnosis:

1. **Decision Tree Classification**
2. **Logistic Regression**

## Results

- Logistic Regression Model:
  - Accuracy: 97%

- Decision Tree Classification Model:
  - Accuracy: 93.5%

## Dataset
